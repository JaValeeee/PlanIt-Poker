I have added in a piechart that shows result after voting, also the legends of the vote. It is able to calculate the average of the score, and the amount of players voted, which has built in logic to calculate if there are more than 1 votes.

I have implemented the active stories function, when a user adds a story, it now goes to the active story, the top active story is also now removed after it is voted on. Additionally, there is now a remove top story button that removes the top active story.

The completed story tab also is updated after it is voted on.
